This is a compilation of mini projects written in Python such as: sending an email, calculator, currency converter...etc.
I use this repository to break down complicated subjects to smaller pieces that are easy to understand.
The goal is to fully understand the basic concepts before using each of these projects in a big project. 

1. Send Email with Python
This project enables us to send email without logging in Gmail as normally

2. Basic Calculator
This is a basic calculator in which a user can perform add, multiple, minus and divide.

3. Email Slicer
This project enables us to split an email into 3 parts: username, domain and extention
It can be implemented as a 1-step account creation for simplicity.
